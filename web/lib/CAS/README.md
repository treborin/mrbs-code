Project is unmaintained
-----------------------

As of June 2024 this library is not actively maintained and looking for active developers & maintainers. The project is in an okay shape and in working order but needs a bit of steady maintenance or maybe even someone who wants to modernize it. We have also documented & automated a lot so I think it's nothing to worry about.

Please contact the CAS project management team if you are interested: https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Project-Commitee.html or through the public mailing lists: https://apereo.github.io/cas/Mailing-Lists.html
